# LearningCpp11Cpp14
Recently I've been involved in MapAPI development using Carla API.
To improve my code quality, I'm reading Effective Modern C++.

As I code using the same style with Carla API for about 2 months,
I find that C++11 is so different from the C++ that I learned during my collage.
I'm eager to be familiar with it and write self-satisfied code.
